    <!-- Purpose: one line on why this prompt exists -->
    <!-- Audience: who will consume the output -->
    <!-- Stakes: why correctness matters (money/safety/reputation/decision) -->

  <Role> <!-- OPTIONAL: Skip if Task+Context already imply persona and tone.
              Keep for advisory/creative/strategic outputs to shape voice and prioritization. -->
  </Role>

  <Context>
    <!-- REQUIRED: Known facts, constraints, prior attempts, timing/season, org specifics. -->
  </Context>

  <Task>
    <!-- REQUIRED: One-sentence imperative with depth/scope ("produce a production-ready...", "compare..."). -->
  </Task>

  <Inputs> <!-- OPTIONAL (REQUIRED if using specific sources): Name the sources/data; note recency/authority. -->
  </Inputs>

  <NonGoals> <!-- OPTIONAL: Use when scope creep is likely; list explicit exclusions. -->
  </NonGoals>

  <Constraints> <!-- OPTIONAL (recommended): Tone, length, reading level, compliance/citation rules, no fabrication. -->
  </Constraints>

  <AdvancedInstructions> <!-- OPTIONAL BLOCK: Use when you want slow, rigorous reasoning or tool control. -->
    <DeepResearch> <!-- OPTIONAL: Ask for multi-source comparison, conflict resolution rules, optimization goals.
                         Skip for simple tasks or speed over depth. --> </DeepResearch>
    <SelfReview> <!-- OPTIONAL: Require internal revision against QualityBar before responding.
                      Skip if you don't need extra rigor. --> </SelfReview>
    <ToolUse> <!-- OPTIONAL: Define browsing/coding/diagram permissions + citation style.
                   Skip if free-form knowledge is fine or tools are disallowed. --> </ToolUse>

  <OutputFormat>
    <!-- REQUIRED for mission-critical results: Detailed section list; include a minimal skeleton or table schema. -->
  </OutputFormat>

  <QualityBar> <!-- OPTIONAL (recommended for high-stakes): 3–6 measurable pass/fail checks tied to Constraints. -->
  </QualityBar>

  <Examples> <!-- OPTIONAL: Provide 1 bad vs 1 good snippet to anchor level and style. -->
    <Bad></Bad>
    <Good></Good>
  </Examples>

  <AmbiguityHandling> <!-- OPTIONAL: Tell GPT to ask up to N questions first OR proceed with listed assumptions if time-boxed. -->
  </AmbiguityHandling>

  <Acceptance> <!-- OPTIONAL: Single line defining “usable as-is” for your workflow. -->

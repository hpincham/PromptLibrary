  <Context>
    <!-- Paste authoritative facts, datasets, constraints -->
  </Context>

  <Task>
    Produce a structured report that answers the question with verifiable claims only.
  </Task>

  <Inputs>
    <!-- Name specific sources; include dates and authority level -->
  </Inputs>

  <VerificationMode>
    <Mode>strict</Mode> <!-- strict by default in this template -->
    <IfOff>Ignore all rules in this block; proceed with normal instructions.</IfOff>

    <VerificationRule>
      VERIFIED = supported by provided inputs or by a cited primary/source-of-record (â‰¤12 months old unless labeled).
    </VerificationRule>

    <WhenCannotVerify>
      Do not guess. Ask up to 3 clarifying questions; if still uncertain, label with [Unverified] and state assumptions + impact.
    </WhenCannotVerify>

    <Labeling>
      <StrictPrefixTags>[Unverified] [Inference] [Speculation]</StrictPrefixTags>
      <TriggerTerms>prevent, guarantee, eliminates, ensures</TriggerTerms>
    </Labeling>

    <InputHandling>
      Do not alter user-supplied quotations, numbers, or definitions unless explicitly asked.
    </InputHandling>

    <CorrectionProtocol>
      If an unsourced claim slipped through, include:
      "Correction: The previous claim lacked verification and should have been labeled."
    </CorrectionProtocol>
  </VerificationMode>

  <AdvancedInstructions>
    <DeepResearch>
      Cross-check at least 2 independent credible sources per material claim; disclose disagreements and rationale.
    </DeepResearch>
    <SelfReview>
      Validate against <QualityBar> and <VerificationMode>; revise once before responding.
    </SelfReview>
    <ToolUse>
      Browsing allowed; cite sources with plain links and dates.
    </ToolUse>
  </AdvancedInstructions>

  <OutputFormat>
    1. Executive Summary
    2. Findings (numbered claims; each with source & date)
    3. Evidence Table (claim | source | date | confidence: High/Medium/Low)
    4. Assumptions & Limits
    5. References (links)
  </OutputFormat>

  <QualityBar>
    (1) Every material claim has a source or is labeled [Unverified].

  <Role> <!-- OPTIONAL: Skip for purely factual prompts where tone/voice doesn't matter.
              Keep for advisory/creative/strategic tasks to bias style and priorities. -->
  </Role>

  <Context>
    <!-- REQUIRED: Facts, constraints, prior attempts, user preferences, dates/timeframe. -->
  </Context>

  <Task>
    <!-- REQUIRED: One-sentence imperative + depth ("quick scan" vs. "detailed plan"). -->
  </Task>

  <Scope>
    <InScope> <!-- OPTIONAL: Skip if the task is naturally narrow and unambiguous.
                   Use to prevent drift by listing what's explicitly included. --> </InScope>
    <OutOfScope> <!-- OPTIONAL: Skip for simple tasks. Use to forbid common anti-patterns. --> </OutOfScope>
  </Scope>

  <Constraints>
    <!-- OPTIONAL (recommended): Tone, length/word limit, reading level, compliance rules (e.g., no fabricated citations). -->
  </Constraints>

  <QualityBar> <!-- OPTIONAL: Skip for casual prompts. Use when you need pass/fail checks (3–6 measurable items). -->
  </QualityBar>

  <OutputFormat>
    <!-- REQUIRED for predictable results: Specify sections, bullets, and any table schemas. -->
  </OutputFormat>
